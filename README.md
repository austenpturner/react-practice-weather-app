# React Weather App

React practice project using OpenWeather API following along with the video [Build 25 React Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdHfJVAY-s) by @sangammukherjee via freeCodeCamp on YouTube.

After following along with the video, I added a Celcius/Fahrenheit conversion button and updated the styles. I also added a config folder for my API key.
